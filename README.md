The Adidas Sales Excel Dashboard project used Microsoft Excel to analyze sales data for the sportswear brand. The project included sales analysis in USD $, regional breakdown, sales by method, and a bar graph of retailers' sales and profit. These insights provide a financial perspective on Adidas's performance and help identify top-performing retailers.
